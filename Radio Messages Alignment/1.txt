Zone A is in effect (Kaleun's note: There are now three conditions for attack.  Outside all zones, prize rules are in effect and you must surface before engaging ships.  Inside the darkened zone, the method of attack is unrestricted.  The lettered zones require that attacks must be made that allow the U-boat to remain undetected by attacking submerged or by attacking at longer ranges at night on the surface).

Group action is possible only if you have the required number of submarines in the operating area. Over the past period of war is very rarely have been able to achieve the required number of subs. |4. The possibility of such action will be the more frequently than a larger number of submarines will be to act in this area, that is the more eye will be busy looking for convoys. |5. In addition, the presence of a large number of subs will not exhibit his routes in England after such action.

The pincers of the 6th Army and 4th Panzer Army finally met up to the west of Stalingrad at Pitomnik. The German troops attempted to break into Stalingrad from the west, but were unable to do so because of limited Red Army counter-attacks against their flanks. Luftflotte 4 continues its round-the-clock air attacks against Stalingrad. The RAF made a record number of sorties in North Africa as desert battle rages. Rommels withdrawal is speeded up by heavy New Zealand pressure.

19430207	0300	19430207	2300	0	100	60	@BEF. UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1943 Feb. 07|On dark nights, when the enemy escorts can see the boat only at close range, the Commanding Officer should always attempt to evade the approaching destroyers, for they have set their course as a result of radar, which however ceases to function at short ranges. Thus if the boat evades at high speed and at right angles to the approach course, the destroyer will probably fail to keep the boat on the radar screen. Whenever possible the U-boat should head the sea, as this will complicate the A/S vessel's radar and lookout. If the destroyer opens fire, the result will often be ineffective, as he will not see the target. In such cases too, an attempt must be made to evade on the surface, for once the U-boat is forced under water it will never succeed in catching up to the convoy. 
19430207	0305	19430207	2300	0	100	60	@BEF. UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1943 Feb. 07|When escort vessels are about, boats must try to remain on the surface as long as possible and must try to avoid being forced under water. They should try to escape on the surface from corvettes, over which they usually have the advantage in speed. The enemy will try, particularly at dawn and dusk, to send his escorts out from the convoy in order to force the greatest number of U-boats to remain submerged, and so remain unaware of the new line of advance of the convoy.
19430207	0310	19430207	2300	0	100	60	@BEF. UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1943 Feb. 07|If escort aircraft are met, particularly before dusk, they should be engaged with A.A. guns, so as not to lose the chance of a night attack on the convoy. Boats should only dive in the presence of aircraft, if they can reach of depth of at least 80 meters. In all doubtful cases they should remain on the surface and fight it out. The crews should be taught to do this, and the danger of being bombed at shallow depths must be explained.

UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1943 March 05|With the exception of two or three doubtful cases, enemy information about the position of our U-boats appears to have been obtained mainly from extensive use of airborne radar, and the resulting plotting of these positions has enabled him to organize effective diversion of convoy traffic. We were slow to realize the technical possibilities of ASV Radar and our counter-measures lagged behind. The frequent appearance of the expression 'radio-located' in the British situation reports complicates our problem of finding the convoys by means of patrol lines, which until now has been our main method. With the object of taking every means of concealing patrol lines from the convoys, as soon as enemy airborne radar has been identified, all boats are at once to dive for 30 minutes. |BdU

The man who allows his healthy warrior and fighter instincts to be hoaxed and humbugged ceases to have any appreciable powers of resistance to present-day enemy defences. He is no longer capable of attack, but feels universally hunted and persecuted. Not only must every opportunity to attack be resolutely seized, but it would also be a grave error to depart from the principles which have been hammered into U-boat crews so hard and so frequently: Get to your position ahead just as quickly as you can, launch your attack just as soon as you can, exploit your opportunities at once and as fully as you can. |BdU

If the boat is able to dive and remain ahead of the convoy, do so.|          b) If the convoy has a strong escort and the boat is detected: if attacked, the boat's job is to take out escort vessels and aircraft to make it easier for other boats.

The boat will have to engage these surface vessels (preferably with G7es Zaunkönig). This means surface vessels will be closing head on - 0° AOB - which is the optimum angle for attack.  Allow at least some time for the escort to straighten its course directly toward the U-boat.
19430805	0930	19430806	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|5 Aug 43 - Tactical Convoy Procedures (Message 3 of 4):|     After diving, preferrably move straight for the destroyer.  U-boat may have to turn to divert aircraft, but should still be able to make a complete turn toward the attacking escort. When the destroyer doesn't know the boat's position, try to ambush it. Above all, stay at shallow depth and rely on G7es Zaunkönigs - make every effort to destroy escorts.  However, if the convoy ships are within range and able to be attacked, they are the priority target, otherwise engage the escort vessels.

Try to engage the escort with a torpedo again if you miss.  Again convoy ships are the priority - do not engage escorts unless it is a necessity.|     In conclusion:|          1. Start unobserved.|          2. If you cannot engage convoy ships without remaining unobserved, engage escort forces. If an escort carrier is sighted, sink it at all costs.

If the Anglo-American landing succeeds, it would mean for us the loss of large territories vital to our war economy and an immediate threat to our most important industrial regions without which the war cannot be continued. The enemy is at his weakest at the very moment of the landing. Everything must be done to hit him at this moment and to inflict such losses on him that he will have no desire ever to try any landings again. Only then, furthermore, can the forces lacking on the Eastern Front be sent there.
19440606	0705	19440606	2300	0	100	60	@BEF. UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1944 June 06|Men of the U-boat arm! On you too the future of our German people depends, now more than at any other time. I therefore require of you the most unstinting action, and no consideration for otherwise valid precautionary measures. Each enemy vessel useful to him for landing is to be subjected to all-out attack, even when there is a danger of losing your own U-boat. Every enemy man and enemy weapon destroyed before landing diminishes the enemy's prospect for success. In this crisis I know that you men of the U-boat arm--who have been tried in the toughest battles--are men on whom I can rely.
19440606	0710	19440606	2300	0	100	60	@BEF. UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1944 June 06|Every enemy vessel supporting the landing, even though it may be carrying only 50 men or a tank, is a target. Press home your attack, even at the cost of your boat. Should it be necessary to close the enemy landing fleet, pay no regard to the danger of shallow water, mines or other hazards. Each soldier and weapon destroyed before reaching the beachhead diminishes the enemy's chance of victory. A U-boat which inflicts losses on the invasion forces fulfils her highest mission and justifies her existence, even though she herself may be destroyed. |BdU

Let us now more than ever rally around our Führer and fight with all our strength until victory is ours. The attempt on the Führer's life was brought about by the clique of generals who were undertaking a military coup.

Even now, when the enemy has succeeded in gaining a foothold on the shore and pushing forward to the east, your full co-operation is necessary to relieve the land front. Always think how much fighting and expenditure of materials, and especially how much blood is necessary to destroy a shipload of men and materials in land fighting. You can do it with a single torpedo hit. I know what hardiness, toughness and endurance you must bring to bear in order to endure the hardships and unceasing attacks. But I also know that you, my U-boat warriors, carried on by the old spirit of attack, think only of destroying the enemy. Be assured that I follow your battle continually and that you are always in my thoughts.

A few Homeports will also be used, since the Norwegian bases have insufficient accommodation, and operational possibilities will thus be limited. The Type IXC boats will no longer be able to operate either in the Caribbean or on the Gold Coast without refuelling, and will therefore be obliged to concentrate mainly on the US coast, the Newfoundland area and also the St. Lawrence, which is again accessible to schnorchel boats. As a rule we shall be unable to use the Type VIIC boats in the Channel, since the passage takes so long that type would be unlikely to arrive in a fit state to operate under such difficult conditions; the only other areas remaining to them are the Moray Firth, the Minch and the North Channel in British coastal waters, and Reykjavik.

19441206	0940	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 5 of 15):|               a. Charging to be carried out in conditions unfavorable for air attack: in general, by night, preferably with conditions of no moon, very dark, haze, fog, and/or storm.|               b. If at night with especially great air and radar activity, charging can be carried out in the daytime, in fog, or in clear weather with good visibility and good AA conditions. Proceeding by night is considered more favorable, since, in the event of an attack, better opportunity is afforded for submerging, and coordinated arial attack is more difficult.

Areas with weak air-defense (Atlantic South of 15 deg. South (top of FJ to FP) and open spaces of the Indian Ocean): On principle, on the surface, FUMB on.|III. Procedure in the operational zone:|     A. Submerged on principle and only while Schnorkelling. On breakdown of Schnorchel, return to base. Use procedure under II.

Lying on the bottom and taking advantage of the density of water which renders it more difficult for the U-boats to be intercepted by hydrophone and radar, facilitate a successful U-boat operation even at a depth of well under 100 metres.|     C. Initiate all measures for daylight attack. Submerged night attack promises success only at full moon.

Especially when the Schnorkel is out of order the boat must continue to run submerged in order to evade the shadowing aircraft and to be as far as possible beyond the range of location of the point of submerging. Therefore when below water, not more than slow speed ahead, and economize on light and air.|Procedure:|     A. In General: Under all circumstances recharge battery completely every day.
19441206	1040	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 11 of 15):|          1. Choose favorable conditions for Schnorkelling, i.e. generally at night, in a swell, poor visibility. By day only in clear weather with good visibility, moderate seas and when the Schnorkel does not smoke. Best at night, once 2-3 hours at the beginning and end of the night.
19441206	1050	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 12 of 15):|          2. The Schnorkel is not undetectable by radar. If the Schnorkel is correctly manipulated it can be scarcely or only inaccurately intercepted. The motion of the sea reduces the possibility of being located. If the Schnorkel is fully raised, it can be located and attacked, therefore it is wrong to let the Schnorkel protrude too far when there is phosphorescence. Then interception through location by radar is possible at a much greater distance and therefore more often than by a trail of foam. The range of location of the camouflaged Schnorkel is about 10% of the boat when on the surface.
19441206	1100	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 13 of 15):|          3. Air attacks on dark nights are generally only possible with the use of artificial light. If a searchlight is detected shining directly on the boat or a flare above it, sound the Schnorkel alarm, and dive to at least 80 metres.  If searchlights and/or flares are detected searching a long way off, or their location is above the Schnorkel dipole, only sound the "quiet-Schnorkel-alarm", that is to say, dive to 20-30 metres.
19441206	1110	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 14 of 15):|          4. When the Schnorkel is in use, periscope manned by the commander and officers of the watch in watches of roughly 1-2 hours.  In boats of type VIIC, turn the main periscope continually by hand. In boat type IXC in general, only the periscope for air observation.
19441206	1120	19441207	2359	1	100	20	@Bdu@^All U-boats^|6 Dec 44 - Standard Operating Procedures (Message 15 of 15):|          5. Noise caused by Schnorkelling is about the same as when the boat is running on both E-engines at a rate of 200 revolutions per minute. In areas where there is hydrophone activity do not refrain from using the Schnorkel because of the fear of being heard. According to experiments, boats have proceeded unperturbed with the Schnorkel in use, with hydrophone bearings of weak signal strength.|          6. Circular acoustic sweeps for enemy positions every 15-45 mins by quickly diving to a depth of 20 metres.

UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1944 Dec. 14|U-boats operating in coastal waters are ordered to remain at periscope depth during the day, and to refrain from going deeper unless they find a water layer in which hydrophone range is likely to exceed optical visibility. Further, commanders are now at liberty to carry out searches for targets beyond the limits of their allotted areas and into bays and inlets, without informing Command. In fact, Command will no longer strictly enforce requirements for regular radio status reports, as all radio traffic is to be kept to an absolute minimum lest the enemy's detection equipment use it to locate and destroy you. |BdU

The fortune of war is infinitely many-sided, and, especially in naval warfare, dependent on chance and the combination of so many circumstances that new situations and new combat situations are presented again and again...A fighting service which is stifled by dogma accomplishes nothing anymore. Many victorious battles have been waged contrary to all the rules of the art of war.

Our honour demands that we fight to the end. The same is required by our pride, which rebels against humbling ourselves before a people like the Russians, before Anglo-Saxon sanctimony, arrogance, and lack of culture. Every thought rebels against the possibility of handing over cultivated German territory to Polish mismanagement. Thus stern necessity, duty, honour and pride bid us fight to the last if need be. Let us not allow to exist...dangers which may injure the fighting morale of the men...trample them out ruthlessly at their first appearance....Be hard and strict rather than too soft.

UNTERSEEBOOTE@|1945 April 11|I turn against the irresponsible and short-sighted weaklings who say "if we had not had National Socialism, all this would not have happened." If we had not had National Socialism we would already have had communism in Germany, further unemployment and political chaos. Without the rearmament which the Führer brought us, Germany would have been trampled over by the Russians in their expansionary push to the west. I turn against the clever people who say we should have avoided the war against Russia in 1941. Had the leadership done that, then the unweakened Russians would have rolled over us long since at a time that suited them. Then those same clever people would have said, "Yes, the leadership should have prevented it with a timely attack on Russia".

Therefore he did away without dignity and monstrous unemployment, made us powerful in defence and attempted to enlighten Europe. On the other side stands this hate-blinded Churchill, the gravedigger of English power, who entered the war in order to preserve the balance of power and to pledge himself to the freedom of small nations. What now remains of power and where has the freedom of the small nations gone? They are provinces of Bolshevik Russia.

Clearly and plainly tread the path of soldierly duty. The honour of our flag on board is sacred to us. No one thinks of giving up his ship. Rather, go down in honour.
