It is intended to equip +?????????????- TWENTY-FIRST series with a new type of weapons defense - rockets ??????????????? from under the water. This underwater missiles +URSEL-. They are intended for sharp contrast aimed at submarine vessels. Purpose in monogastric animals sector angles will be provided ????????????????? station +SP-ANLAJE-, posted in the stern of the deck add-ins. Primary goals for the detection distances up to 10 miles will be ????????????????? station, the exact purpose for cruiser fleet attacks from under water: according to neurodynamics, not ???????? under Renk HSWL.
19431014 1035 19431014 2,355 1 100 10 @the German shipyard@ ^gold medallist-admiral Carla ??????^ /14 october 1943/.  As studies have shown , "Hydrodynamic excellence +????????????- TWENTY-FIRST series will favorably affect the noise from those ships. Their noise when driving under the main email engines with speed of 15 bonds is equivalent noise of american navy units subs-reaching the 8-mi sites. When 5.5 sites under the email. engines ?????????????, noise from twenty-first century is comparable with noise +??????????- at the low speed (about 2 ties).  The driving mode, quiet design boat twenty series in a few times in the range mutual hydroacoustic detection destroyers, which consecrated convoys.
19431118 1045 19431118 2,355 1 100 10 @the German shipyard@ ^gold medallist-admiral Carla ??????^ /18 November 1943/.  Our designers have developed a modification boat TWENTY Series: XXI? and XXI?. To them, in the middle of the chassis are installed additional USS Nautilus , began units deployed at an angle to the longitudinal axis plane and aimed in forage - diagram +?????????-. The tactics of such subs provides intersection course convoy with ????????????? under his court. The proximity to the shooting is really acoustic direct from the stern, and the departure from the on-board. The recharging is not envisaged. The entire anti-tank guided missile can be used in the course of one powerful lightning attack. 19440717 19440717 0940 2,355 1,100 10 @gold medallist admiral Karl ?????@ ^commanders U-twenty^ /17 July 1944/.  For your subs series twenty-first century, high- underwater qualities developed a special tactics. When convoys, you must take a position in front, and then risked upsetting Moscow in the underwater position at the highest possible speed, break through strenuous and take place under the courts within a warrant. Then, while driving, together with the courts convoy to a depth 30 - 50 meters, and hiding behind their container ships from enemy ships, not to carry out an attack ???????? really direct. ????????? optical sighting, you must immerse yourself in the maximum depth and low noise up to circumvent the forage of convoy.

While in reverse propulsion motors are at one with them shaft "Kolomensky Zavod" through the system will be subjected to temperatures at room ventilation provides keeping allowable gas constitution suck in water. The driving mode under the +?????????- indicated high noise compressors, excessive vibration +????????- and Spaniards seemed never to speeds above 10 knots (the desired speed 12 ties. ).  Risk of damage to hoisting the hulls devices and is not able to monitor the environment was forced to limit speed U-twenty-first century under +?????????- 6-nodes. Designers are working on resolving these problems.
19440727 1000 19440727 2,355 1 100 10 @gold medallist admiral Karl ?????@ ^commanders U-twenty^ /27 July 1944/.  It was found that in the real world conditions of combat the subs series twenty-first century, with a limited time charging, it is virtually impossible to completely and evenly charge all batteries group. Because the main rowing email engines use voltage 360V, and power consumer high firing rate is shock 120A: this will result in uneven classified as different groups battery and the charging mode before charging the least discharged and only after that a discharged battery group. There is not enough effective, and the flare of hydrogen, allocated rechargeable batteries. This has led to an explosion hydrogen-air mixture at the +U-3002fashion.

Driving tests in conditions of combat subs series twenty-first century have revealed that when driving with large speeds under the main email.engines submarine magnetic field increases so that to ensure that the desired security U-TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY from magnetic mines is almost not possible. Pipe Gasket ?????????? drainage system so that it voluntarily transferring air bags. There is no access to service ??????????? and a number of subsidiary mechanisms energy installation.

For accommodation assembly line subs TWENTY Series it was decided to use the largest and powerful shelter: +VALENTIN-. Its concrete walls thickness 4.5 meters, overlaps: 7.3 meters. That allows you to withstand ???????????? bombs. Inside shelter created assembly deeper pipeline, as well as on the ??????????. In the end, the assembly line is not in the dock the camera, in which PL descend on the water, and the two waterfront is their signage and ????????????. To carry out a road test submarine are displayed from the shelter through armoured gateways and on the river Weser in North Sea. On schedule, according to the plan every 56 hours should go beyond the new submarine.
